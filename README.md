# ESP32 Racing Wheel
Bluetooth PC racing wheel controller for driving games using an ESP32 with some libraries. 

This repo includes software only. The mechanical part was some old (quite bad) logitech racing wheel. I just reconnected the buttons and potentiometer sensors for wheel position and gas/brake to the ESP32 to be sent over Bluetooth to the PC. Works actually fine with most of the games, although it's quite a simple solution to extend the life of an old racing wheel.
